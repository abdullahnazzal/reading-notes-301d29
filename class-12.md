## **Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**


| SQL      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Relational Databases  | non-relational |
|  table based databases  |document based |
|  predefined schema  | dynamic schema |
| vertically scalable  | horizontally scalable|
| structured query language   | Unstructured Query Language|

## **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
    
Any data but not hierarchical data storage.

## **Give a real world example.**

MySQL.

## **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. 

## **Give a real world example.**

Hbase.

## **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL database.

## **Which type of database is best for scalability?**

NoSQL database.

## **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

Tables.

## **What is a ‘schema’?**

Is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects.

## **What is a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL is a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first.

## **How does it work?**

NoSQL databases don't store in tables but in something more flexible data models(document).
 
## **What is inside of a Mongo database?**

Documents, Collections

## **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB, because I don't have to use schema
 
## **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don’t support ACID).

# Readings: FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## **What is functional programming?**

Is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

## **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

pure functions is functional programming,

So how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:

1- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).

2- It does not cause any observable side effects

## **What are the benefits of a pure function?**

The code’s definitely easier to test.

We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts.

## **What is immutability?**

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed,

When data is immutable,
its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

## **What is Referential transparency?**

referential transparency= pure functions + immutable data

## **What is a module?**

Is a functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files 

## **What does the word ‘require’ do?**

The require() function will return an object, function, property or any other JavaScript type to load and use Module.

## **How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

By useing require() function to load Module.

## **What do we have to do to make a module available?**

By export the module, use module.exports= function.

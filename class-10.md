## **What is a ‘call’?**

function invocation.

## **How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**

one.

## **What does LIFO mean?**

**LIFO**: principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

**LIFO**: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

## **Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.?**
